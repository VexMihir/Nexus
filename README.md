# Nexus

This is a repo for our 416 Nexus Design Project.

There is no script to run all of the components together, instead you have to go into each of the folders and start the components seperately. There are a few different packages that you need, including websocket, and roundrobin. The components meaning the Agent within the backend folder, and the Frontend Controller in the Frontend controller. For the backend agent, all you have to run is 'python app.py' within the Backend/Agent folder, then run 'python controller.py' within the Frontend folder. To start the frontend, you must download all of the package.json dependencies, then run 'node server.js' to start the server, then you can open the index.html file.
